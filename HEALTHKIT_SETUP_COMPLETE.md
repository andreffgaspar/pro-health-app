The HealthKit integration has been fully configured for both iOS and Android platforms.

## ‚úÖ Completed Configurations

### 1. **Capacitor Configuration** (`capacitor.config.ts`)
- Updated plugin configuration for `CordovaPluginHealth`
- Added comprehensive health data permissions for read/write operations
- Configured all supported health data types

### 2. **iOS Configuration**
- **App.entitlements**: Created with HealthKit capabilities and background delivery
- **Info.plist**: Added HealthKit usage descriptions and device capabilities
- **project.pbxproj.patch**: Reference for manual Xcode configuration

### 3. **Android Configuration** 
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Added Google Fit and Health Connect permissions
- Configured activity recognition and health data permissions
- Added Google Play Services metadata

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added comprehensive logging to `cordovaHealthService.ts`
- Enhanced initialization debugging in `useHealthIntegration.ts`
- Added platform detection and plugin availability checks

## üîß Manual Steps Required

After pulling this code to your local development environment:

1. **Run Capacitor Sync**:
   ```bash
   npx cap sync ios
   npx cap sync android
   ```

2. **iOS Setup (requires Xcode)**:
   - Open `ios/App/App.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Add HealthKit framework to the project
   - Verify entitlements file is linked
   - Test on a physical iOS device (HealthKit requires real device)

3. **Android Setup (requires Android Studio)**:
   - Open the Android project in Android Studio
   - Verify permissions are applied
   - Test on a physical Android device with Google Fit or Health Connect

## üì± Testing the Integration

1. **Debug Mode**: Check browser console for detailed logs about plugin detection
2. **Permission Flow**: The app will now properly request HealthKit permissions
3. **Data Sync**: Once permissions are granted, health data will sync automatically

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If "Health data is not available" still appears:
1. Ensure you're testing on a physical device (not simulator)
2. Check console logs for plugin detection errors
3. Verify Capacitor sync was run after code changes
4. Confirm device supports HealthKit/Google Fit

The integration now includes comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms.
